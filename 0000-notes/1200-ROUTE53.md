> [!NOTE] What is a Route53 Hosted Zone?
>
> A DNS database for a domain, e.g. animals4life.io
>
> - It's what the DNS system references for a domain.
> - In other words, hosted zone is the Authoritative nameserver of a domain.

R53 Public Hosted Zones - Overview

> [!NOTE] How many nameservers does a Public Hosted Zone have?
>
> 4 Route53 nameservers

> [!NOTE] What is the accessibility of a R53 Public Zone?
>
> A R53 Public Zone can be accessed from:
>
> - the public internet
> - AWS VPCs.

> [!NOTE] For a Public Hosted Zone, what is the DNS query process of the AWS VPC?
>
> - VPC Instances are configured with the VPC `+2 Address` (R53 Resolver).
> - Any resources in the VPC can query public DNS and R53 Public Hosted Zones record.

R53 Private Hosted Zones - Overview

> [!NOTE] What is the accessibility of a R53 Private Hosted Zone?
>
> A R53 Private Hosted Zone can only be accessed by the VPCs (which with it is associated).
>
> - These VPCs can be from the same account or different accounts.
> - The public internet cannot access R53 Private Hosted Zones.

R53 Split View Hosted Zones

> [!NOTE] What is R53 split-view DNS?
>
> Using the same domain name (`example.com`) for
>
> - internal uses (`accounting.example.com`)
> - external uses, such as your public website (`www.example.com`)
>
> Or even using the same sub-domain for both public (external) and internal usage.

## CNAME vs R53 Alias (5:19)

`CNAME` record - Problem

> [!NOTE] What is `CNAME` record?
>
> A `CNAME` record:
>
> - maps _DNS queries for the name of the current record_, such as `acme.example.com`
> - to:
>   - another domain (`example.com` or `example.net`)
>   - or subdomain (`acme.example.com` or `zenith.example.org`).

R53 `alias` record

> [!NOTE] What is `alias` record?
>
> Amazon Route 53 `alias` record is a Route 53–specific extension to DNS functionality.

> [!NOTE] What does R53 `alias` record do?
>
> R53 `alias` record:
>
> - route traffic _**to** selected AWS resources_, such as
>
>   - CloudFront distributions
>   - Amazon S3 buckets.
>
> - route traffic _from one record_ in a hosted zone _to another record_.

> [!NOTE] Why use R53 `alias` record?
>
> - Unlike a CNAME record, we can create an R53 `alias` record at the top node of a DNS namespace, also known as the `zone apex`.
>
>   e.g. DNS name `example.com`:
>
>   - We can't create a `CNAME` record for `example.com`
>   - But we can create a R53 `alias` record for `example.com` that routes traffic to `www.example.com`.
>
> - We can use a R53 `alias` record to route traffic to many AWS resources.
>
>   Many AWS resources don't have a static IP address. They only have a DNS name, e.g. `lb1-1234.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
>
>   With R53 `alias` record, we can route directly traffic to these DNS name, without allocating an additional [Elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html).

![Alt text](../1200-ROUTE53/00_LEARNINGAIDS/Route53SimpleRouting-1.png)

> [!NOTE] What is R53 `Simple Routing`?
>
> Routing traffic to a single resource, for example, to a web server for your website.

> [!NOTE] What is the drawback of R53 `Simple Routing`?
>
> `Simple Routing` doesn't support health check.

>
> Yes.

> [!NOTE] What is the different between `Simple Routing` and `Multi Value Routing`?

> - With `Multi Value Routing`, a hosted zone can have _**multiple records** with the **same name**_
