>   - **EFS `Standard`** / Standard-IA
>   - EFS `Archive`
>
> - Performance Mode:
>
>   - **`General Purpose` mode** (default - 99.9% of uses): Lowest latency
>   - `Max I/O` mode: Highly parallelized workloads that can tolerate higher latencies
>
> - Throughput Mode:
>
>   - `Bursting` mode: Throughput scale with storage
>   - Enhanced
>     - **`Elastic` mode** (default - recommend): Spiky/unpredictable workloads
>     - `Provisioned` mode: Known performace requirements; or throughput > 5% average-to-peak ratio
