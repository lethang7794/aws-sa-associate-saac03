Service-linked Roles

> [!NOTE] What is Service-linked Role?
>
> A service-linked role is
>
> - a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to an AWS service.
> - predefined (by the service) to include all the permissions that the service requires (to call other AWS services on your behalf).

> [!NOTE] Why use Service-linked Role?
>
> A service-linked Role
>
> - simplify the process of setting up a service because
>
>   - you don't have to manually add permissions for the service to complete actions on your behalf
>
> - may be created
>   - automatically (by the service)
>   - manually using a wizard in the console
>   - manually using IAM
>
> See [Create a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html)

> SCP
>

> - (do NOT grant permissions)

SCP - Deny List

> [!NOTE] SGP - Deny List Strategy
> With _deny list strategy_, all permissions are allowed unless explicitly denied.
>
> This is the _default_ behavior of AWS Organizations.
>
> - By default, AWS Organizations attaches an AWS managed policy called `FullAWSAccess` to all roots, OUs, and accounts.
> - You
>   - leave the default `FullAWSAccess` policy in place (that allow "all").
>   - then attach additional policies that explicitly deny access to the unwanted services and actions.

> [!NOTE] Can SCP restrict management account?

> SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account. They affect only the member accounts in your organization.

> [!NOTE] Can SCP restrict root user?
>
> SCP can un-directly control the member account's root user (by control the account's permission)
