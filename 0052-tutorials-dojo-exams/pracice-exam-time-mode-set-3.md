A solutions architect is managing an application that runs on a Windows EC2 instance with an attached Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. To save cost, management has decided to stop the instance during off-hours and restart it only when needed. It has been observed that the application takes several minutes to become fully operational which impacts productivity.

How can the solutions architect speed up the instanceâ€™s loading time without driving the cost up?

- Migrate the application to a Linux-based EC2 instance.
- Migrate the application to an EC2 instance with hibernation enabled.
- Enable the hibernation mode on the EC2 instance.
- Disable the Instance Metadata Service to reduce the things that need to be loaded at startup.
```

> EC2 - Hibernation
>
> - Quickly pausing and resuming the instances, by saving the memory footprint to disk.
> - Can only be enable at launch
> - Pay as stopped instances:
>   - No hourly charging
>   - EBS volume.
>   - Elastic IP Address.

An on-premises server uses an SMB network file share to store application data. The application produces around 50 MB of data per day, but it only needs to access some of it for daily processes. To save on storage costs, the company plans to copy all the application data to AWS, however, they want to retain the ability to retrieve data with the same low-latency access as the local file share. The company does not have the capacity to develop the needed tool for this operation.

Which AWS service should the company use?

- AWS Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
- AWS Snowball Edge
- AWS Storage Gateway
```

> NFS vs Storage Gateway

A Data Analyst in a financial company is tasked to provide insights on stock market trends to the company's clients. The company uses AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs in daily report generation, which involves fetching data from an Amazon S3 bucket. The analyst discovered that old data from previous runs were being reprocessed, causing the jobs to take longer to complete.

Which solution would resolve the issue in the most operationally efficient way?

- Increase the size of the dataset used in the job to speed up the extraction and analysis process.
- Parallelize the job by splitting the dataset into smaller partitions and processing them simultaneously using multiple EC2 instances.
- Create a Lambda function that removes any data already processed. Then, use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to trigger this function whenever the ETL job's status switches to SUCCEEDED.
- Enable job bookmark for the ETL job.
